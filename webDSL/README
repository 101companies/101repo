== Summary ==
This projects provides a very simple WebDSL WebApp for companies.

== Description ==

We define pages (company/department/employee view), the company model and a sample company (meganalysis). 

=== Architecture of the project ===

"webDSL.app" is the "main file", containing the page definitions.
"company.app" holds the company model while meganalysis.app contains "meganalysis" as an instance of the model. 

== Requirements ==

We make use of the WebDSL Plugin. Update Site: http://webdsl.org/page/Download

== Demo ==

# Build the project by running the Ant Build file
# Select the project in the package explorer -> right click -> Run As -> Run on Server
# Select your preferred server (we made use of Apache -> Tomcat v6.0 Server) and click "Next"
# Click "Download and Install" and follow the menu's steps
# Click "Finish"
# The project will be published on the installed server
# Visit http://localhost:8080/webDSL/ 
(Eventually you will have to re-build or restart the server)
