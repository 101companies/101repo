== Intent ==
this projects provides a very simple WebDSL WebApp for companies

== Languages ==
* [[Language:JavaScript]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]
* [[101feature:Distribution]]

== Motivation ==

We define pages (company/department/employee view) using the [http://webdsl.org WebDSL] DSL. 
We also provide a metamodel for companies and scenerios to [[101feature:Cut|cut]] and [[101feature:Total|total]] salaries. 

=== Architecture of the project ===

"webDSL.app" is the "main file", containing the page definitions.
"company.app" holds the company model while meganalysis.app contains "meganalysis" as an instance of the model. 

== Usage ==

We make use of the WebDSL Plugin. Update Site: http://webdsl.org/page/Download
