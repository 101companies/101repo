We implement some "company" scenarios in Haskell.
There is a function "total" to total all salaries in a company.
There is a function "cut" to cut all salaries in half.
There is a function "depth" to compute the nesting depth of departments.
We use "Scrap your boilerplate" (SYB) style of generic programming.
See the Makefile for running the tests.
The code has been tested with GHC 6.10.
We rely on Haskell 98 extensions for SYB.
