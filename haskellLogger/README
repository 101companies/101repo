[[101feature:Logging|logging] in [[Language:Haskell]] by means of the [[Writer Monad]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Haskell]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:GHCi]]

== Features ==

== Motivation ==

TBD

== Illustration ==

TBD

== Architecture ==

TBD

== Usage ==

The Haskell module ''Main'' has to be consulted with GHCi, and the
''main'' function has to be applied so that output for the test
scenarios is produced. The ''expected'' output is available through
the file ''baseline''. There is a ''Makefile'' with a target ''test''
for [[test automation]].
Use the taget ''clean'' to "reset" the project.
