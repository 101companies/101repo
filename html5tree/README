== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:HTML5]], [[Language:JavaScript]], [[Language:php]] and [[Language:SQL]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]
* [[Language:php]]
* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:MySQL]]
* [[Technology:XAMPP]]
* [[Technology:JSON]]
* [[Technology:Apache_HTTP_Server|Apache HTTP Server]]
* [[Technology:XMLHttpRequest]]
* [[Technology:jQuery]]
* [[Technology:Webbrowser]] (HTML5 compliant)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]
* [[101feature:Precedence]]
* [[101feature:Validation]]

== Motivation ==

* A company with many departments and employees is not clearly arranged with the current [[101feature:Interaction#Navigation|navigation]]. Unlike, a treeview provides a complete overview of the whole company without exhausting much space in the GUI.
* This implementation extends the [[101implementation:html5ajax|html5ajax]]-implementation with a treeview and a refitted [[101feature:Interaction|GUI]].
* It also introduces new [[101feature:Create|create]]- and [[101feature:Delete|delete]]-features for the company.

== Illustration ==

* To get an overview of the [[Technology:JSON]]-messages, visit the [[101implementation:html5ajax]] project.
* This is an example for a [[Technology:JSON]]-message, which [[101feature:Delete|deletes]] a department:

<syntaxhighlight lang="text">
{
	"id":1,
	"table":"department",
	"action":"delete"
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The simple request is received by the [[server-side]] [[Language:php]] script and deletes the department with the id 1 on the [[server]]. In this implementation, the cascading delete anchored in the database provides a recursive deletion for all containing subdepartments:

<syntaxhighlight lang="php">
        $request = "DELETE FROM department WHERE id = " . $id;
        mysql_query($request);
</syntaxhighlight>

== Architecture ==

* The architecture is similar to [[101implementation:html5ajax]], except that most of the html-elements of the view are located in the [this!!index.html].

== Usage ==

You need a web- and sql-server to use this application. In this tutorial both will be taken by XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

This tutorial adopts some parts of [[101implementation:mySql]]. The company.sql and sampleCompany.sql are modified for this project. They are located in the "sqlScripts" folder.

* Download and install XAMPP
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Use the guideline of [[101implementation:mySql]] up to "Populate tables..." with the modified sql-scripts.

After the database is running, follow the next steps:

* To start the application, you need to download all project-files except the README
* Put the files into the htdocs-directory of your XAMPP (a new sub-directory in "htdocs" is recommended)
* Run index.html

The project is provided as a netbeans-project. If you want to change the code, you have to:

* Download (http://netbeans.org/) and install [[Technology:NetBeans]]
* "Open project" and select the html5tree-folder
