== Usage ==

You need a web- and sql-server to use this application. In this tutorial both will be taken by XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

This tutorial adopts some parts of [[101implementation:mySql]]. The company.sql and sampleCompany.sql are modified for this project. They are located in the "sqlScripts" folder.

* Download and install XAMPP
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Use the guideline of [[101implementation:mySql]] up to "Populate tables..." with the modified sql-scripts.

After the database is running, follow the next steps:

* To start the application, you need to download all project-files except the README
* Put the files into the htdocs-directory of your XAMPP (a new sub-directory in "htdocs" is recommended)
* Run index.html

The project is provided as a netbeans-project. If you want to change the code, you have to:

* Download (http://netbeans.org/) and install [[Technology:NetBeans]]
* "Open project" and select the html5tree-folder
