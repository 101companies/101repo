== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:HTML5]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:DOM]]
* [[Technology:XMLHttpRequest]]
* HTML5-compliant [[Technology:Browser|browser]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

While the most [[Language:HTML5|HTML5]] implementations provide [[client-side]] data storage, this implementation attends to [[server-side]] data storage. The [[client]] requests for ''company.xml'' over http-request and loads the data directly from this xml.
