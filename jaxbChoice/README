== Intent ==

[[O/X mapping]] with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XSD]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXB]]
* [[Technology:xjc]] (part of JAXB)
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

See [[101implementation:jaxbComposition]] for the overall motivation of exercising 
[[Technology:JAXB]] and arguably a simple baseline for a schema and the 
corresponding schema-derived classes. The present implementation exercises
an XSD choice for different kinds of subunits. The schema-derived class
Subunit encodes the choice in an arguably sub-optimal manner (as a result
of the lack of a good match for XSD choices in the Java type system).
One could expect that XSD choices (of a restricted kind) could be 
translated into class inheritance, but this does not happen here (and
this may be understandable).
