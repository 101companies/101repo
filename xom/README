== Intent ==

exercise [[in-memory XML processing]] with [[Technology:XOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:XOM]]: variation on [[Technology:DOM]] API
* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.4.1)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

The data model for companies is provided as an XML schema.

Validity is not checked or otherwise implied.

== Terms ==

* [[:Category:XML processing]]

== Motivation ==

See [[implementation101:dom]] for a general motivation for exercising
[[in-memory XML processing]]. The present implementation simply exercises
yet another DOM-like API. We end up providing a descendants axis to this
end.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.xom.Tests''.
