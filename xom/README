== Intent ==

exercise [[in-memory XML processing]] with [[Technology:XOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:XOM]]
* [[Javaclipse]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]

== Motivation ==

See [[101implementation:dom]] for a general motivation for exercising
[[in-memory XML processing]]. The present implementation simply exercises
yet another DOM-like API. We end up providing a descendants axis to this
end.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
