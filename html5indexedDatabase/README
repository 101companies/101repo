== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:HTML5]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:B-Tree|B-Tree]]-based indexed database

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

The indexed database is the current alternative to the (deprecated) [[101implementation:html5sqlDatabase|web database]] in HTML5. Apart from web storage ([[101implementation:html5local|local storage]] and [[101implementation:html5session|session storage]]), the indexed database feature gains the main support in relation to [[offline storage]].

== Usage ==

* Open the 101companies.html with your web-browser (check [[Language:HTML5|HTML5]] for the HTML5-support of your browser)

== Contributors ==
