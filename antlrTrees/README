== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

Both concrete and abstract syntax is defined for companies.
To this end, we use an ANTLR-based parser description.
The abstract syntax is based on ANTLR's homogeneous tree format.
The resulting tree is walked with an ANTLR tree grammar to total all salaries or to cut salaries in half.
