== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

We define both concrete and abstract syntax for companies.
To this end, we use an ANTLR-based parser description.
The ANTLR-based specification constructs trees according to ANTLR's generic tree format.

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]] 
* [[101feature:Parsing]] 

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

* [[Technology:ANTLR]]
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Usage ==

See [[101implementation:antlrAcceptor]] for general instructions on the usage of ANTLR-based implementations.
