== Intent ==

exercise [[push-based XML parsing]] with [[Technology:SAX]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XSD]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:SAX]]
* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of SAX
* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.4.1)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Architecture ==

[[101feature:Company]] is implemented by an XML Schema in Company.xsd.

The tests also demonstrate validation with regard to the schema.

All Java modules are hosted by package ''org.softlang.sax''.

[[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]] are implemented as SAX handlers.

The implementation of [[101feature:Cut]] also requires ''javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter''.

There are also bonus modules ''Trace'' and ''Validator'' for tracing and validation.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.sax.Tests''.

Hint: if you need to add schema files to a project so that XML files are 
automatically validated on the grounds of their namespace, as it is useful for
the schema Company.xsd, which is part of the present implementation, then follow
this advice: http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/07/21/add-xsd-file-eclipse-and-eliminate-those-pesky-xml-warnings
Add the .xsd file to XML catalog.
