We use SAX for XML processing.
We exercise some company scenarios.
There is one SAX handler to total all salaries.
There is another SAX handler to cut all salaries in halt.
The latter handler also leverages XMLStreamWriter.
We also perform validation and tracing for SAX parsing.

See the Tests class for test cases.

BTW, if you need to add schema files to a project, do it like this:

Add the .xsd file to XML catalog.
