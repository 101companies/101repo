== Intent ==

[[in-memory XML processing]] with [[Technology:DOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of DOM and other XML functionality
* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

Companies are represented in [[Language:XML]] and the object model of DOM is used to
represent and process XML documents in memory. In particular, operations on companies
are implemented in Java on top of the (generic) DOM API. DOM trees are easily queried 
so that operations such as [[101feature:Total]] can be implemented with ease on in-memory
XML trees. DOM trees are also mutable so that operations such as [[101feature:Cut]] can
be implemented as [[impure computation]]s on in-memory XML trees.

== Illustration ==

Consider the following DOM-based implementation of ''cut'':

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
public class Cut {
   public static void cut(Document doc) {
      NodeList nodelist = doc.getElementsByTagName("salary");
      for (int i=0; i<nodelist.getLength(); i++) {
         Element elem = (Element)nodelist.item(i);
         double value = parseDouble(elem.getTextContent());
         elem.setTextContent(Double.toString(value / 2));
      }
   }
}
</syntaxhighlight>

That is, the method receives an in-memory XML document which it queries with the
descendant axis (see ''getElementsBy'') so that all salary elements are collected
in a ''NodeList'' which is processed by a regular loop such that the text content
of the salary elements is modified to reflect a cut in half.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in package ''org.softlang.tests''.

== Issues ==

* DOM-based validation shall be demonstrated some day.
