== Intent ==

exercise [[in-memory XML processing]] with [[Technology:DOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of DOM and other XML functionality
* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.4.1)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Data exchange]]

== Terms ==

* [[:Category:XML processing]]

== Motivation ==

DOM represents XML in memory and provides rich axes on the representation.
For instance, one can even navigate upwads from children to ancestors.
Also, the representation is generic, whereby it is easy to navigate data generically as well.
DOM trees are also mutable, whereby it is easy to transform data.
The basic features of 101companies are easily implemented hence.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.dom.Tests''.

== Issues ==

* DOM-based validation shall be demonstrated some day.

== Contributors ==

* {{101contributor|Ralf LÃ¤mmel|developer}}
