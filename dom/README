== Intent ==

exercise the basic 101companies features with [[Technology:DOM]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of DOM and other XML functionality
* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.4.1)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]] (no explicit model)
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

Read XML into DOM objects.

Query DOM objects with DOM axes.

Transform DOM objects impurely.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.dom.Tests''.

== Issues ==

* DOM-based validation shall be demonstrated some day.
