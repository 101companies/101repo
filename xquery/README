== Intent ==

exercise [[:Category:XML processing]] with [[Language:XQuery]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XQuery]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Saxon]]: Free XQuery
* [[Technology:BaseX]]: Free XQuery incl. update facility
* [[Technology:JSE]]: Version 6 needed for BaseX

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]

The data model for companies is provided as an XML schema.

Validity is not checked or otherwise implied.

== Architecture ==

There are two implementations of [[101feature:Cut]]:
* cut.xq: uses XQuery w/o update facility
* cut.uf.xq: uses XQuery w/ update facility

== Usage ==

See the Makefile for running some tests.

Versions of Saxon and BaseX are included in the code repository for this implementation.

Tested with this version of BaseX:

<pre>
$ java -cp basex/BaseX61.jar org.basex.BaseX -h
BaseX 6.1; DBIS, University of Konstanz
Usage: BaseX [-dioqsvVxz] [query] [-c]
  [query]    query file
  -c<cmd>    database commands
  -d         debug mode
  -i<file>   XML input
  -o<file>   output file
  -q<expr>   query expression
  -s<pars>   serialization parameters
  -v/V       show (all) process info
  -w         wrap query result to xml
  -z         skip query output
</pre>

Tested with this version of Saxon:

<pre>
$ java -jar saxon/saxon9he.jar
No source file name
Saxon-HE 9.2.1.2J from Saxonica
Usage: see http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/using-xsl/commandline.html
Options: 
   ...
</pre>

Tested on the following machines:

<pre>
	Darwin ... 9.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 9.8.0: Wed Jul 15 16:55:01 PDT 2009; root:xnu-1228.15.4~1/RELEASE_I386 i386

	Linux ... 2.6.32-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Fri Apr 16 08:09:38 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
		(both test-saxon and test-basex-unix)
	Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]
		(both with and without update facility)
</pre>

The project can be opened with Eclipse for convenience.
