This directory is used as a class pool for the class-loading sample.
That is, we store some .java files over here that are not under the compilation management of Eclipse.
Also, this location is not part of the regular class path.
Hence, it is really up to our clever class loader to find and load and perhaps even compile these classes.

It is recommended to start from a "clean" directory.
See the Makefile.
