The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

We persist company objects by making use of hibernate.

It is a bit tricky to reproduce the demo.
This is because we rely on the state of the persistence component.
So please follow the instructions given below.

###############################################################

Prerequisites
- Tested with Java 6 SDK
- Tested and saved with Eclipse 3.5

###############################################################

Requirements
- The hsqldb distribution and a minimal set of Hibernate .jar's (see library Project @ Sourceforge: 
  http://developers.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/developers/repository/101companies/code/library/hibernate)

###############################################################

Content of distribution
- Classes with functionality to cut and total salaries (see package org.softlang.or).
- Makefile with *optional* conveniences.

###############################################################

Steps of a typical demo

1. Make sure you start from an initial distribution.

2. Build the project with Eclipse.

(The following steps are explained in detail below.)

3. Start the HSQL database server.

4. Run org/softlang/Main.java to create tables.

5. Run the database monitor and populate the tables with scripts/PopulateTables.

6. Patch hibernate.cfg.xml to disable "drop and re-recreate".

7. Run org/softlang/Main.java again.


###############################################################

How to start the database server?

Start it from the command line.
It is a Java program.
Go to the data dir of the distribution.
Run the following command:
> java -classpath ../../library/hibernate/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server 
You can also send it to the background if you like.

You can also go to the root dir and run a "make start-db".

###############################################################

How to run org/softlang/main.java?

1. Comment out lines 13-31 
2. Run to create new tables.
3. Undo step 1


###############################################################

How and why to start the database monitor?

Start it from the command line.
It is a Java program.
Run the following command:
> java -classpath ../library/hibernate/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing
You can also send it to the background if you like.

You can also go to the root dir and run a "make start-gui".

When the GUI pops up, make sure to select "HSQL Database Engine Server".
If you had performed Main already, you see the tables of the app.

Populate these tables:
- Open scripts/PopulateTables (File -> Open Script)
- Press "Execute SQL"

Try an SQL command such as SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE;
You can see the row count; -> View; -> Show Row Counts.
You can shut down the server from here; see menu Command.

###############################################################

How and why to patch hibernate.cfg.xml?

You can edit that XML file in Eclipse.
It is the configuration that is used for Hibernate for persistency.
Upon the first use the EventManager the database must be initialized.
Hence it says:
<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property>
Subsequently, we want to keep all data.
Hence the line should be commented out.
<!-- <property name="hbm2ddl.auto">create</property> -->

###############################################################

Run org/softlang/Main.java again. It will demonstrate the use of Cut and Total.
