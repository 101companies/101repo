We implement some "company" scenarios in Prolog.
There is a predicate total/2 to total all salaries in a company.
There is a predicate cut/2 to cut all salaries in half.
There is a predicate depth/2 to compute the nesting depth of departments.
See the Makefile for running the tests.
The code has been tested with SWI-Prolog 5.10.1.
