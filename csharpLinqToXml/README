== Intent ==

[[Technology:.NET]] Language Integrated Query usage for [[Language:XML]] processing 

== Languages ==

* [[Language:CSharp]](C#): Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: Framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: Unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==
Basic style of [[OO programming]] is applied. C# type system is used to create in-memory representation of the [[object model]].

LINQ2XML is used for 2 scenarios:
1. Reconstruct full in-memory model.
2. Imlement operations directly on top of XMl file where the model is stored.

TODO


== Architecture ==
C# object-oriented representation of 101companies model iimlemented in [[101implementation:csharp]] is used. It contains classes with required properties and methods(features implementations).
TODO
1. manual reconsctruction of object model from xml
2. transformations for pure xml model representation without using OO-model

== Usage ==
[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file.
The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.
