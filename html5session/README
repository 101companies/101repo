This is a simple implementation of the basic 101companies-features in html5. It provides client-side storage for the data, which are deleted after closing the session. Apart from that, it is mostly identical to [[101implementation:html5local]].

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]

== Technologies ==

* An HTML5-compliant browser

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Usage ==

This HTML5-program does not work over file-protocol of the browser. 

To gain access over http, you can use, for example, XAMPP to create a webserver.

# Download XAMPP from http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html
# Install XAMPP
# Deploy the index.html to your htdocs-directory (for example: E:\xampp\htdocs\101implementation-html5\)
# Start the XAMPP-Control Panel and activate Apache
# Start your web-browser
# Call http://localhost/101implementation-html5/index.html
