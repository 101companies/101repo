== Intent ==

put to work XML data binding with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Implementations ==

See [[101implementation:jaxb]] for simpler JAXB-based implementation.
It is simpler in so far that the underlying XML Schema is simpler, and hence, 
the resulting object model is easier to operate on. 
In particular, the simpler XML Schema deliberately avoids XSD-like subtyping 
(i.e., complex type extension), which implies that the resulting object model 
also does not involve subtyping, and hence, it is more straightforward 
to provide functionality on the object model. Here we emphasize 
that we are de-facto constrained to use static Java methods for functionality 
on the schema-derived classes---unless we were willing to modify schema-derived classes.
