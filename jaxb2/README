== Motivation ==

See [[101implementation:jaxb]] for the overall motivation of exercising 
[[Technology:JAXB]] and for arguably a simple baseline of a schema and 
corresponding schema-derived classes. The present implementation exercises
an XSD choice for different kinds of subunits. The schema-derived class
Subunit encodes the choice in an arguably sub-optimal manner (as a result
of the lack of a good match for XSD choices in the Java type system).
One could expect that XSD choices (of a restricted kind) could be 
translated into class inheritance, but this does not happen here (and
this may be understandable).
