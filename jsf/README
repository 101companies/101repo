== Illustration ==

== Architecture ==

== Usage ==

You need an sql-server to use this application. In this tutorial both will be taken by XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

You can use the ''company.sql'' and ''sampleCompany.sql'' of [[101implementation:mySql]] for this project.

* Download and install XAMPP
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Use the guideline of [[101implementation:mySql]] up to "Populate tables..."

After the database is running, follow the next steps:

* To start the application, you need to download all project-files except the README
* Open the project with [[Technology:NetBeans]] (http://netbeans.org/)
* Select the project, right click and ''run''
* The glassfish-server (and a browser window) with the application will start automatically

The project is implemented with [[Technology:NetBeans]] 7.0.1. You will need the full version with an installed [[Technology:Glassfish]] [[webserver]].
