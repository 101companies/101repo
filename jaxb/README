== Summary ==
We use JAXB for XML processing.

== Description ==

We exercise some scenarios for companies.
We compute the total for companies.
We cut the salaries in half. 
See the Tests class for test cases.

=== Architecture of the project ===

The org.softlang.company package contains code generated by jaxb (xjc).
See the Makefile for an indication of deriving Java classes from XSD.
xjc is part of the Java SDK since Java 6.

BTW, if you need to add schema files to a project, do it like this:
