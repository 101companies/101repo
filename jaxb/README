== Intent ==

put to work XML data binding with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XSD]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXB]]: XML data binding technology
* [[Technology:xjc]]: XML Schema-to-class compilation (part of JAXB)
* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac, xjc, et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.6)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.jaxb.Tests''.
* If you want to regenerate classes from the scheme, see the ''Makefile''.

Hint: if you need to add schema files to a project so that XML files are 
automatically validated on the grounds of their namespace, as it is useful for
the schema Company.xsd, which is part of the present implementation, then follow
this advice: http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/07/21/add-xsd-file-eclipse-and-eliminate-those-pesky-xml-warnings
Add the .xsd file to XML catalog.
