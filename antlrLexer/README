== Intent ==

tokenizing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

A lexer for companies is defined.
The lexer is, of course, oblivious to the precise structure of companies.
Simple queries are expressible nevertheless.
That is, [[101feature:Total]] can be implemented by searching for number tokens.

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Totol]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:ANTLR]]
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Usage ==

See [[101implementation:antlrAcceptor]] for general instructions on the usage of ANTLR-based implementations.

== Contributors ==
