The packages demonstrate various issues in concurrent (parallel) programming.

Only the basic thread library and expressiveness of Java is used.

- dining.naive: deadlock-prone Dining Philosophers

- dining.simple: deadlock-prone Dining Philosophers

- dining.semaphore: variation on ...simple that uses semaphores

- dining.threadpool: as before, but with a thread pool

- dining.timeout: deadlock-free, livelock-prone, subject to starvation, too; busy loop

- dining.stabilized: left-handed philosopher; in principle, starvation may still happen

- banking: credit card transactions on a shared credit card

- sumlength.sequential: compute sum of length of an array of strings (sequentially)

- sumlength.parallel: compute sum of length of an array of strings (in parallel)

- sumlength.distributed: compute sum of length of an array of strings (in parallel/distributed manner)

- slowstringreverser: reverse string with a thread and poke at result with future

- concurrent: an implementation of semaphores with logging
