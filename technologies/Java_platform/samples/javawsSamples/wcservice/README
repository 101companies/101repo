The following procedure has been tested on the following configuration:
- Eclipse 3.6 (EE)
- JBoss 5.1
- Mac OS Snow Leopard
- Java 1.6

------------------------------------------------------

How to install JBoss in Eclipse 

1.

Make sure you have an appropriate Eclipse version:
Eclipse for Java EE developers

2.

Make sure you have JBoss 5.
http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/
This project has been tested with 5.1.0.GA.
Look for the following archive in particular:
jboss-5.1.0.GA.zip

3.

This project relies on Java 6.

(
For JBoss 5 to work with Java 6 you need to follow these instructions:
http://www.jboss.org/file-access/default/members/jbossas/freezone/docs/Installation_And_Getting_Started_Guide/5/html/source_installation.html#Java6_Notes
We explain the relevant issues below.
Hence, you can skip the above link.
)

4. 

Click right mouse on Project and select
New->Server->JBoss v5.0 and provide path to JBoss directory. 
Don't forget to select JDK 1.6

5. 

It's VERY advisable to change timeout for server's startup (unless you have a very fast system). 
DOUBLE CLICK on the servers in "Servers" tab (next to console) and increase timeout time in "Timeouts" section.
(Add "0" in the end to get factor 10 increase.)

6.

It's time to test the sever.
Run the JBoss server.
One way to do is to select a JBoss project with a WebService and to run through JBoss.
To this end, do something like this:
Click right mouse on Project and select
"Run As ... " Run on the Server.
Select JBoss 5 Server.
Press Finish.

In the Console window, you should see the Server starting shortly.
In the Service tab, you should find the service listed under the Server.

6.

Stop the server.

------------------------------------------------------

Running projects with the JBoss Server

1. 

Make sure JBoss Server is properly installed; see above.

2.

Make sure the project has been ran once as described above.

3.

The run configuration for the server needs to be refined.
Open "Run configurations", select Generic servers -> JBoss server, open tab "Arguments".
Look at the VM settings.
You should see something like this:
-Dprogram.name=run.bat -Xms128m -Xmx512m  -XX:MaxPermSize=256m 
These settings would have been set up by the previous step.
Add the following to the field "VM arguments"
-Djava.endorsed.dirs=/JBOSS_HOME/lib/endorsed/
For example:
-Dprogram.name=run.bat -Xms128m -Xmx512m  -XX:MaxPermSize=256m -Djava.endorsed.dirs=/Users/laemmel/software/jboss-5.0.0.GA/lib/endorsed/

4. 

You can now start the server and proceed with building and testing the client.
