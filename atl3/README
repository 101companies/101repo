This is a variation on project "alt2" (and hence on "alt").
Make sure you understand and can run "alt" and "alt2".
This variation is potentially obscure.

In comparison to "atl2", we start by modeling with KM3 (as opposed to
Ecore). (Again we make use of subtyping---just like in "alt2" but not
in "alt"). With an older version of the ATL Plugin [1] we are able to
convert the KM3 metamodels to Ecore metamodels (Right-click on the KM3
file in the Package Explorer -> Inject KM3 to Ecore metamodel).  When
selecting the metamodel(s) in the run configurations menu use the
.ecore not the .km3 files.

COMMENTS:

KM3 does not support setting Packages' namespace URIs, so for
Company.ecore we either have to set this property manually or have to
use "Company" (being the Package's name) in the source models.

When we take a look at the EData Type "String [null]" in the EPackage
"PrimitiveTypes" in the company metamodel, we would expect "null" to
cause some trouble. It is the value of the EData Type's "Instance Type
Name" (or "instanceClassName" in XMI representation) property.  One
might have expected "java.lang.String". Fortunately the ATL VM sets
this property to "java.lang." + name (here "String") whatever the
property's value was [2].
