We use Jena for RDF processing.
Jena is a Java framework for building Semantic Web applications.
http://jena.sourceforge.net/downloads.html
We exercise some company scenarios.
The present project illustrates Jena's based RDF API. 

See the Tests class for JUnit test cases.


Package ...jena.rdf

We leverage Jena's basic RDF API (package com.hp.hpl.jena.rdf.model).
We use statement iterators to iterate over RDF resources.
In this manner, we total salaries, cut salaries, and check constraints.


Package ...company

We provide a builder for company RDF models.
We also show construction code for a sample company.
The rest of the code uses the sample stored in .rdf file stored in the root dir.
