== Intent ==

a very very OO implementation of the basic spec in Scala

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Scala 2.8.1]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Scala]]: The Scala compiler and runtime library (Version 2.8.1)
* [[Technology:sbt]]: Simple Build Tool - a build tool for Scala projects (Version 0.7.4)
* [[Technology:sbt-idea]]: A plugin to generate IntelliJ IDEA project descriptions from sbt projects (Version 0.4)
* [[Technology:ScalaTest]]: A library for BDD and unit testing in Scala (Version 1.3)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

This defines a minimal approach to realize the basic spec using Scala's OO features. In Scala terms this could be considered a ''Java without semicolons'' implementation.

== Architecture ==

The implementation features fully mutable classes and total and cut are implemented as instance methods. The implementation contains three files:

* ''Company.scala'' contains everything related to the Company entity
* ''Employee.scala'' contains classes describing the company personnel
* ''Dept.scala'' contains the implementation of Departments

== Usage ==

You need to install sbt to build and run this project as shown on the sbt [http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup website]. Then change into the base directory of the project and run
 <nowiki>sbt update</nowiki>
This should fetch all needed dependencies. After that you can compile the project by typing
 <nowiki>sbt compile</nowiki>
and then
 <nowiki>sbt test</nowiki>
to run the tests.
