== Intent ==

a simple implementation in [[Language:Java for Hadoop]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JDK]]: provider of javac et al.
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.6.2)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]
* [[101feature:Parallelism]]

== Motivation ==


== Architecture ==

Package ''org.softlang.company'' hosts the object model for [[101feature:Company]].
Package ''org.softlang.operations'' hosts designated classes with static methods for
the MapReduce jobs [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]]. Some boilerplate code for 
[[101feature:Serialization]] is implemented in the class ''org.softlang.company.Company'' 
(see methods ''readObject'' and ''writeObject''). Package ''org.softlang.tests'' 
hosts JUnit tests; see below.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* The default settings runs [[Hadoop]] on your local machine. For distributed setup see below.
* There are JUnit tests available as the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Serialization'' with JUnit to create and serialize an example Company.
** Run class ''Basics'' with JUnit to exercise basic features.

== Distributed Setup ==

An official release for Hadoop can be downloaded here: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/releases.html
The Hadoop Wiki describes how to set up Hadoop in local (http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/single_node_setup.html)
and distributed mode (http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/cluster_setup.html).

These configurations require jobs being run via the command line using a jar file. The jar can be build
from our Eclipse project by simply specifying the class ''OperationRunner'' as main class. 

Using Hadoop in distributed mode under Eclipse is not that trivial. Instructions can be found here:
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EclipseEnvironment

== Possible issues ==

Running Hadoop under Windows requires ''Cygwin'' being installed. Instructions can be found here:
http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GettingStartedWithHadoop

Hadoop also requires ''ssh'' to access all machines (including ''localhost'') without password prompt.
Instructions how to do this can be found for example here: http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~dhruba/tips_and_tricks/node2.html
