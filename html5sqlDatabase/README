== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:HTML5]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]
* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* An HTML5-compliant browser

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

This is a simple implementation of the basic [[101section:Features|101companies-features]] in [[Language:HTML5|HTML5]] with [[Language:SQL|SQL]]. It provides [[client-side storage]] for the data in a client-side web database.

== Illustration ==

The data is stored in a offline sql database.

 <syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
 main.db = openDatabase('101companies', '1.0', 'companies database', 2 * 1024 * 1024);
 </syntaxhighlight>

This command sets the name, the version, a short description and the size of the database (in Byte). After the initialization, the data can be created with sql transactions:

 <syntaxhighlight lang="javascript">
 main.db.transaction(function (tx) {
 	// department
 	tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Department (id UNIQUE, name, cid, did)');		
 	});
 }
 </syntaxhighlight>

== Architecture ==

There is no special architecture for [[Language:HTML5|HTML5]] web database. The functions are all defined in the index.html.

== Usage ==

Just open the index.html with your browser.
