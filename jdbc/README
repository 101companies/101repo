== Intent ==

Database programming with [[Technology:JDBC]]

== Status ==

[[101status:Broken]]: the underlying database has grossly changed.

== Languages ==

* [[Language:SQL]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JDBC]]
* [[Technology:MySQL]]
* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Description ==

We use JDBC/SQL for data processing.
We exercise some company scenarios.
That is, we use embedded SQL in Java.

See the Tests class for test cases.

Prerequisites:

- A suitable company database.
  Please use project "sql" to set up the company database.
  That is, we assume that you have an initial database image.
  Tests will only succeed for an *initial* database image.
  Corollary: tests will succeed at most once.

- A suitable JDBC Driver for MySQL:
  An appropriate driver is available through the project "library".
  See the corresponding JAR in the build path of the present project.
