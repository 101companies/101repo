== Intent ==

Database programming with [[Technology:JDBC]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:SQL]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JDBC]]
* [[Technology:MySQL]]
* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Description ==

We use JDBC/SQL for data processing. We exercise [[101feature:Total|totaling]] and [[101feature:Cut|cutting]] salaries as well as computing the [[101feature:Depth|depth]] of a company. 
That is, we use embedded SQL in Java.
See the Tests class for test cases.
  
== Usage ==

* You will need a suitable JDBC Driver for MySQL
**  An appropriate driver is available here: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
**  Add the JAR that comes with the download to the build path of this project.
* Set up a company database.
** Follow the steps described here [[101implementation:mySql]] to set up the company database. That is, stop after populating the tables. 
* There are JUnit tests available as the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Basics'' with JUnit to exercise basic features.
