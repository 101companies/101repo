101companies in Scala using Kiama
Tony Sloane, January 2011

Note that the containment scenario is not relevant for Scala since the data
type ensures that the desired topology cannot be violated.

Use the simple-build-tool to build: sbt script for Unix and MacOSX and
sbt.bat script for Windows.

* (One time only) Download Scala compiler and needed libraries.

$ ./sbt update

This downloads and installs the relevant jars in your project, so you
need to be on the net for it to work. The remaining steps can be
performed without a net connection.

* To compile the project (if necessary) and run the main program:

$ ./sbt run
399747.0
199873.5
3

* To run the tests with logging:

$ ./sbt info test
