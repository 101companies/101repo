== Intent ==

exercise [[:Category:XML processing]] with [[Language:XPath]] embedded in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XPath]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Xalan-Java]]: implementation of XPath
* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of DOM and other XML functionality
* [[Javaclipse]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

XPath can be embedded in Java code which makes it possible to process
query results in Java. Query results are bound to DOM-like node sets, and
one can iterate over those and mutate them, thereby implementing
impure transformations.

== Architecture ==

Xalan-Java is included into the code distribution of this implementation.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available though class ''org.softlang.xpath.Tests''.
