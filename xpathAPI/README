== Intent ==

exercise [[:Category:XML processing]] with [[Language:XPath]] embedded in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XPath]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Xalan-Java]]: implementation of XPath
* [[Technology:JAXP]]: implementation of DOM and other XML functionality
* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

XPath can be embedded in Java code which makes it possible to process
query results in Java. Query results are bound to DOM-like node sets, and
one can iterate over those and mutate them, thereby implementing
impure transformations.

== Architecture ==

See [[101implementation:dom]] for a very similar implementation.
The main difference to the [[Technology:DOM]]-based implementation
is really that an XPath query is used in the place of a DOM query axis. 
Xalan-Java is included into the code distribution of this implementation;
it implements an XPath processor.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project. 
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Operations'' with JUnit to exercise basic operations.
