== Intent ==

exercise [[:Category:XML processing]] with [[Language:XSLT]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XSLT]]
* [[Language:XSD]]

== Technologies ==

Any XSLT implementation may do.

Two processors were tested and their usage was scripted in a Makefile.

* [[Technology:xsltproc]]
* [[Technology:Saxon]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

The data model for companies is provided as an XML schema.

Validity is not checked or otherwise implied.

== Motivation ==

XSLT is easily applied to the basic query/transformation features.
Structurally recursive,
[[endogenous transformation]]s are taken care of by XSLT transformations
that leverage the "copy-recurse" idiom for all elements that do not require
any "local" change; see below. Structurally recursive queries are handled similarly;
output mode "text" is used, though.

'''"copy-recurse" idiom:'''

<pre>
	<xsl:template match="@*|node()">
		<xsl:copy>
			<xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
		</xsl:copy>
	</xsl:template>
</pre>

== Architecture ==

Each of the implemented query/transformation features is modeled by a designated XML transformation.

== Usage ==

See the Makefile for running some tests.

An xsltproc implementation is readily available on OS X, Linux et al.

A version of Saxon is included in the code repository for this implementation.

Tested with this version of xsltproc:

<pre>
$ xsltproc -V
Using libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
xsltproc was compiled against libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
libxslt 10124 was compiled against libxml 20703
libexslt 813 was compiled against libxml 20703

Also possible to work with Saxon from:
	http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ or http://www.saxonica.com/
</pre>

Tested with this version of Saxon:

<pre>
$ java -jar saxon/saxon9he.jar
No source file name
Saxon-HE 9.2.1.2J from Saxonica
Usage: see http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/using-xsl/commandline.html
Options: 
   ...
</pre>

Tested on the following machines:

<pre>
	Darwin ... 9.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 9.8.0: Wed Jul 15 16:55:01 PDT 2009; root:xnu-1228.15.4~1/RELEASE_I386 i386

	Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]
		(only saxon due to the lack of xsltproc)
</pre>

The project can be opened with Eclipse for convenience.
