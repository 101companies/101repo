See the Makefile for running some tests.

An xsltproc implementation is readily available on OS X, Linux et al.

A version of Saxon is included in the code repository for this implementation.

Tested with this version of xsltproc:

<pre>
$ xsltproc -V
Using libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
xsltproc was compiled against libxml 20703, libxslt 10124 and libexslt 813
libxslt 10124 was compiled against libxml 20703
libexslt 813 was compiled against libxml 20703

Also possible to work with Saxon from:
	http://saxon.sourceforge.net/ or http://www.saxonica.com/
</pre>

Tested with this version of Saxon:

<pre>
$ java -jar saxon/saxon9he.jar
No source file name
Saxon-HE 9.2.1.2J from Saxonica
