== Intent ==

exercise SYB-style generic programming with reflection in Java

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Features == 

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

Reflection, in fact, introspection is known to be sufficient for object traversal. 
The operations [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]] essentially need to perform object traversal to find all employees and their salaries. 
We provide a simple SYB-style library for object traversals. 

== Architecture ==

TBD

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project. 
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Basics'' with JUnit to exercise basic features.
