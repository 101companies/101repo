== Intent ==

database programming with [[Technology:HaskellDB]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Haskell 98]]
* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:HaskellDB]]
* [[Technology:HDBC]]
* [[Technology:GHCi]]      

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

We make use of [[Technology:HaskellDB|HaskellDB]] to express [[Database|database]] [[Query|queries]] as [[Language:Haskell]] functions rather than [[Language:SQL]]-statements. That is, we use the rich [[Combinator Library|combinator library]] of HaskellDB to express [[101feature:Total|totaling]] and [[101feature:Cut|cutting]] statements based on [[Rational algebra|rational algebra]]. We demonstrate:

* Projection
* Selection
* Aggregation
* Renaming

We connect to the underlining [[Technology:MySql]] database we use an HaskellDB [[Technology:ODBC|ODBC]] backend.

This implementation also demonstrates the use of [[Technology:DBDirect]]. We use this [[Tool|tool]] to generate the [[Haskell module|Haskell modules]], which are describing the database. The modules are the basis quering the rational data.
