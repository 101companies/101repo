== Intent ==

[[O/X mapping]] with [[Technology:JAXB]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:XML]]
* [[Language:XSD]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JAXB]]
* [[Technology:xjc]] (part of JAXB)
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

See [[101implementation:jaxbComposition]] for the overall motivation of exercising 
[[Technology:JAXB]] and for arguably a simple baseline of a schema and 
corresponding schema-derived classes. The present implementation 
represents an attempt to model different kinds of subunits of department 
(i.e., sub-departments and employees) as subtypes of a common supertype 
of subunits, where subtyping is meant here in the sense of XSD's type 
extension mechanism. The result is rather complex at both ends.
