== Intent ==

implement a web application with Struts

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]
* [[Language:JavaServerPages]]

== Features == 

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation == 

This is a simple web implementation of the basic 101companies-features using  
Struts2 (annotations) and Serialization as persistence mechanism. 
It provides server-side storage for the data using serialization.

== Illustration == 

The data is stored in a file with serialized data. To obtain the stored data, we implemented 
several services within the CompanyService class, which is a singleton.

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
public class CompanySerivce { 
 ...
 private static CompanyService instance;
 
 public static CompanyService instance() {
   if(instance == null) {
     instance = new CompanyService();
   }
   return instance;
 }
	
 public List<Company> listAllCompanies() {
   if(companies == null || companies.size() == 0) {
     companies = new ArrayList<Company>();
	 Company company = Company.readObject("sampleCompany.ser");
	 companies.add(company);
	}
	return companies;
 }
 ...
}
</syntaxhighlight>

== Usage ==
	
=== Requirements ===
	
	        Any web server based on Servlet technology, such as Tomcat.
	        
=== Build === 

	        (a) run "mvn clean package" in the root directory of the Struts 2 implementation of 101companies
	        (b) copy target/struts2app.war to the webs app of your web server

=== Accessing the system ===
	
	        (a) start the web server
	        
	        (b) start a web browser and inform the URL http://localhost:8080/struts2app, if the web server is configured to accept requests on the 8080 port
