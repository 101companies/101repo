== Intent ==

a simple implementation in [[Language:Cobol]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Cobol 85]]

== Technologies ==

Any Cobol 85 compiler should do.

* [[Technology:OpenCOBOL]] (Version 1.0)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]

== Motivation ==

Cobol is a language that readily comes with means of data modeling and
storage (persistence). Hence, it provides a good fit for the basic features
and persistence.

== Architecture ==

Directory hierarchy:
* ''programs'': main Cobol programs for sample data and features
* ''copybooks'': copybooks reused across the different programs
* ''data'': location for keyed files
* ''baselines'': baselines for automated test; see below

== Usage ==

There is a ''Makefile'' that exercises all features in some scripted order.
All programs are compiled with the OpenCobol compiler and executed with 
its runtime.

== Issues ==

It would be interesting to provide a Cobol-like user interface.
