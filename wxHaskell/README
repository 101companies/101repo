== Intent ==

Provide [[101feature:Interaction|interaction]] on companies by means of [[Technology:wxHaskell]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Haskell]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:wxHaskell]]
* [[Technology:GHC]]
* [[Technology:GHCi]]      

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]

== Motivation ==

We use the [[Technology:wxHaskell]] library to provide a simple GUI for companies. 
One can navigate the hierachical company structure and edit fields of types string and number. 
We make use the [[Zipper]] concept to specify which part of the company should be shown or saved after editing.
This concept also helps us to read departments/employees from a given position within the company and write manipulated departments/employees back.  

== Architecture ==


There is also a simple API (''API.hs'') to companies providing reading and writing (see Motivation) and getters and setters.

== Usage ==

The ''Main'' module has to be compiled using GHC the output executable has to run. There is a ''Makefile'' with a target ''start'' covering both stepts. Also, there is a ''clean'' target to reset the project.
