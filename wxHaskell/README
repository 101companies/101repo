== Intent ==

Provide [[101feature:Interaction|interaction]] on companies by means of [[Technology:wxHaskell]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Haskell]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:wxHaskell]]
* [[Technology:GHC]]
* [[Technology:GHCi]]      

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]

== Motivation ==

We use the [[Technology:wxHaskell]] library to provide a simple GUI for companies. 
One can navigate the hierachical company structure and edit fields of types string and number. 
We make use the [[Zipper]] concept to specify which part of the company should be shown or saved after editing.
This concept also helps us to read departments/employees from a given position within the company and write manipulated departments/employees back.  

== Illustration ==

In the ''Main'' module we use xwHaskell's <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">start :: IO a -> IO ()</syntaxhighlight>. This function runs the given GUI of type <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">IO a</syntaxhighlight> while discarding <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">a</syntaxhighlight> and returning <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">IO ()</syntaxhighlight> (code can be found in [this!!Main.hs]):

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell">
gui :: IO ()
gui = do
    f <- frame [ textBgcolor := colorRGB 112 128 144 
               , resizeable := False
               , fontWeight := WeightBold
               , fontUnderline := False
               , position := Point 50 50]
    p <- panel f [textColor := colorRGB 18 19 51]
    showCompany f p CompanyFocus company 

main :: IO ()
main = start gui
</syntaxhighlight>

<syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">gui</syntaxhighlight> creates the main frame for all views and creates a panel for the root view. After that the function calls <syntaxhighlight lang="haskell" enclose="none">showCompany</syntaxhighlight> passing the frame and the panel, the root focus and a sample company provided by the ''SampleCompany'' module (in [this!!SampleCompany.hs]).
]


=== Showing an employee ===



=== Cutting an employee's salary ===



== Architecture ==

There is also a simple API (''API.hs'') to companies providing reading and writing (see Motivation) and getters and setters.

== Usage ==

The ''Main'' module has to be compiled using GHC the output executable has to run. There is a ''Makefile'' with a target ''start'' covering both stepts. Also, there is a ''clean'' target to reset the project.
