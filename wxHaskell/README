== Intent ==

provide [[101feature:Interaction|interaction]] on companies by means of [[Technology:wxHaskell]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Haskell 98]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:wxHaskell]]
* [[Technology:GHC]]
* [[Technology:GHCi]]      

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]

== Motivation ==

We use the [[Technology:wxHaskell]] library to provide a simple GUI for companies. 
One can navigate the hierachical company structure and edit fields of types string and number. 
We make use the [[Zipper]] concept to specify which part of the company should be shown.
This concept also helps us to read departments/employees from a given position within the company and write manipulated departments/employees back.  

== Architecture ==

We make use of the [[101feature:Cut|cutting]] and [[101feature:Total|totaling]] functionality provided by [[101implementation:haskell]], but use a slightly modified algebraic datatype for [[101feature:Company|companies]].
There is also a simple API ([this!!API.hs]) to companies providing reading and writing (see [[#Motivation|Motivation]]) and getters and setters.

== Usage ==

There is a [this!!Makefile] with a target ''test'' to start the GUI.
