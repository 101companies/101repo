The second part contains a layer of web-specific components.

* 1. Download Seaside for Pharo (http://www.seaside.st/download/pharo).
* 2. Open Seaside environment.
* 3. Open "world" context menu within seaside (right click or double left click). Tools->File Browser. Navigate to the "implementations\seaside" folder in your svn repository.  
* 4. Select ''101companies.st'' and click "install" on a toolbar.
* 5. Select ''101companies-Tests.st'' and click "install" on a toolbar.

At this point you should be able to see 101comanies and 101companiesTests in the components browser.
Next you have to start a web-server. For this go to the "Seasise Control Panel", select [8080]WAComancheAdaptor and click "Start" button.

If you don't see any adapters:
* 1. Open the ’Seaside Control Panel’ in the ’Tools’ submenu of the ’World’ menu
* 2. Should there be no WAComancheAdaptor add one by right clicking and selecting ’Add adaptor...’
* 3. Select the WAComancheAdaptor and press ’Start’.

Open http://localhost:8080/101companies in your web-browser.
