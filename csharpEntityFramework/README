== Intent ==

object [[persistence]] and [[O/R mapping]] with [[Technology:.NET]] [[Technology:Entity Framework]]

== Languages ==
* [[Language:CSharp]](C#): Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)

== Technologies ==
* [[Technology:csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: Framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:Entity Framework]] Entity Framework toolkit (Version 3.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: Unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5.9.1034)
* [[Technology:SQL Server]]: SQL Server 2008 used as a data storage. (Free Express edition is enough)

== Features ==
* [[101feature:Company]] (generated from [[101implementation:sqlServer]] data model)
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]

== Motivation ==
Entity Framework object model is generated for SQL Server representation of 101companies model. 

== Architecture ==
CompanyModel.edmx represents all Entity Framework artifacts required for O/R Mapping. This is an XML file contains:
* SSDL content
* CSDL content
* C-S mapping content
* EF Designer content
<nowiki>and also a *.cs file with C# objects.</nowiki>

<nowiki>*.edmx files are visualized in Entity Data Model Designer by default, but also can be opened as raw xml files.</nowiki>
The Entity Data Model Designer (Entity Designer) stores storage model information in an .edmx file at design time. 
At build time the Entity Designer uses information in an .edmx file to create the .ssdl file that is needed by the Entity Framework at runtime.
 
Tests folder contains unit tests showing implemented features.

== Usage ==
[[101implementation:sqlServer]] should be evaluated as soon as current implementation requires [[101feature:Company]] to be created in the database.

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file.
The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.
