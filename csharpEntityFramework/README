== Intent ==

an implementation for [[Technology:SQL_Server|SQL Server]] with [[Techology:.NET]] [[Technology:Entity_Framework|Entity Framework]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Language:CSharp]](C#): Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:Csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: Framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:Entity_Framework|Entity Framework]] Entity Framework toolkit (Version 3.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: Unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5.9.1034

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==
Entity Framework model is generated for SQL Server representation of 101companies model. Unit tests for operations are attached.

== Architecture ==

== Usage ==
[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file.
The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.
