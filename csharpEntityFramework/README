== Intent ==

an implementation for [[Technology:SQL_Server|SQL Server]] with [[Technology:.NET]] [[Technology:Entity_Framework|Entity Framework]]

== Languages ==
* [[Language:CSharp]](C#): Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)

== Technologies ==
* [[Technology:csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: Framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:Entity Framework]] Entity Framework toolkit (Version 3.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: Unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5.9.1034)
* [[Technology:SQL Server]]: SQL Server 2008 used as a data storage. (Free Express edition is enough)

== Features ==
* [[101feature:Company]] (generated from [[101implementation:SQL Server]] data model)
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]

== Motivation ==
Entity Framework model is generated for SQL Server representation of 101companies model. 

== Architecture ==
CompanyModel.edmx represents all Entity Framework artifacts required for O/R Mapping. This is an XML file contains:
* SSDL content
* CSDL content
* C-S mapping content
* EF Designer content
 
and also a *.cs file with C# objects.

Tests folder contains unit tests showing implemented features.

== Usage ==
[[101implementation:SQL Server]] should be evaluated as soon as current implementation requires [[101feature:Company]] to be created in the database.

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file.
The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.
