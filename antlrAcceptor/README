== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

A concrete syntax for companies is defined 
using the grammar notation of ANTLR 
so that a parser--in fact, an acceptor, can be generated.
The underlying grammar is LL(1).

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]] 
* [[101feature:Parsing]] 

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:ANTLR]]
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Usage ==

See the the package ''org.softlang.tests'' for JUnit tests.

The Antlr tool (including parser generator and runtime) is included into the project.
There is a Makefile at the top of the project and within the org.softlang.antlr package.
Run "make" at either of these locations to re-generate the parser.
Refresh the project in Eclipse if you re-generated outside Eclipse.
In this manner, the parser is compiled.

You may also use an ANTLR IDE.
