== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

We define a concrete syntax for companies.
We use ANTLR to execute that syntax in an acceptor-like manner.

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]] 
* [[101feature:Parsing]] 

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Javaclipse]]
* [[Technology:ANTLR]]
* [[Technology:make]]

== Usage ==

See the the package ''org.softlang.tests'' for JUnit tests.

The Antlr tool (including parser generator and runtime) is included into the project.
There is a Makefile at the top of the project and within the org.softlang.antlr package.
Run "make" at either of these locations to re-generate the parser.
Refresh the project in Eclipse if you re-generated outside Eclipse.
In this manner, the parser is compiled.

You may also use an ANTLR IDE.
