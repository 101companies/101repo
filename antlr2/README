We define both concrete and abstract syntax for companies.
We use ANTLR to execute that syntax in a parser-like manner.

See the Tests class for test cases.
The test case(s) simply prints the AST.
We use ANTLR's generic tree format to represent ASTs.

See project "antlr" for general instructions on ANTLR usage.
