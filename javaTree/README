== Intent ==

Tree based implementation in [[Language:Java]].

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]] (Version 5)

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Swing]]
* [[101profile:Simple Java|Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]

== Motivation ==

''This project was created at the PTT-Hackathon 2011.''

The tree-based view allows the user to get a large overview of the hierarchy of the [[101companies:System]]. The tree allows easy [[101feature:Interaction#Navigation|navigation]] within this hierarchy. The tree also provides quick adjustment on changes of the [[101feature:Company|company]] data.

== Illustration ==

The main features [[101feature:Cut]], [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Company]] are adopted from [[101implementation:javaInheritance]]. The main difference to [[101implementation:swing]] is, that the [[101feature:Interaction#Navigation|navigation]] is simplified with a tree view. This tree has to be initialized recursively with the company as root:

<syntaxhighlight lang="java">
/*
 * This method initializes the tree-view.
 */
private Component createTree() {
	Company company = model.getCompany(); // get company data

	DefaultMutableTreeNode root = new DefaultMutableTreeNode(company); // create root element

	for (Department d : company.getDepts()) { // run through the departments and add them to the root
		root.add(addDepartmentNode(d)); // create department subtrees
	}

	tree = new JTree(root);

	return new JScrollPane(tree); // return the JTree within a scroll pane
}
</syntaxhighlight>

The department subtrees are created in a similar way.

== Usage ==

* This project is provided as an [[Technology:Eclipse]] project.
* After importing the project into [[Technology:Eclipse]] as ''Java Project'', just run Interaction.java as ''Java Application''.
