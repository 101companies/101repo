== Summary == 
The present project provides a simple implementation of 101companies in Clojure. 

== Description ==

We define the company's hierarchical structure by making use of clojure's defrecord.
defrecord will generate compiled class bytecode for companies, departments and employees. Each class with a set of the given fields. 

There are two scenarios: Cutting and summing up salaries in a company.
We also provide a sample company (meganalysis).   

=== Architecture of the project ===
 
In company.clj we make use of clojure's defrecord to define the companies structure.
scenarios.clj provides functionality to cut and total salaries.
A sample company can be found in meganalysis.clj

== Requirements ==

We make use of CounterClockwise: http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/ 
Update Site:
http://updatesite.counterclockwise.googlecode.com/hg/

== Demo ==

To run a demo:
* Open meganalysis.clj
* Hit "run"
* Type "(totalCompany meganalysis)" or "(totalCompany (cutCompany meganalysis))" to cut and total the sample company's salaries.
