== Intent ==

implement a web application with Struts

== Technology ==

This is an apache struts 2 application, which presents a simple company model.

We make use of the struts2.2.1 library.

See http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts221

== Motivation ==

TBD

== Usage ==

(a) run mvn clean package
(b) copy the target/struts.war file to the webapps direcoty of your Tomcat distribution
(c) start your Tomcat distribution
(d) point your browser to http://localhost:8080/struts (replacing the port if necessary) 

== Issues == 

* Make sure implementation is idiomatic and robust
* struts:xml -- are all declarations really needed and chosen well?
* Use object model of 101implementation:java (copy)
* Use serialized sample of 101implementation:java (copy)
* Manager should be editable just like employee
* Potentially simplify Controller/Service; no service object needed
* Add cut
* Add substantial README/code documentation
