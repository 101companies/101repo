== Intent ==

an implementation of the basic spec in [[Language:Scala]] utilizing Scala's builtin XML handling features.

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Scala]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Scala]]  The Scala compiler and runtime library (Version 2.9.0.1)
* [[Technology:sbt]]: Simple Build Tool - a build tool for Scala projects (Version 0.10)
* [[Technology:Specs]]: A library for BDD and unit testing in Scala (Version 1.4)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]] (through XML)

== Motivation ==

This implementation shows the use of XML literals which are built into Scala at language level. At no point, an object model is generated beyond Scala's internal XML representation.

== Architecture ==

All relevant code is contained in ''CompanyXMLReader.scala''. The cut and total capabilities are contained in a singleton object by the same name. In ''Validator.scala'', a default XML Schema validator is provided for testing purposes.

== Usage ==

This implementation uses sbt 0.10 as build tool, available at [http://github.com/harrah/xsbt/]. After installing sbt just change into the project directory and run
 <nowiki>sbt</nowiki>
to create the project, followed by
 <nowiki>sbt update</nowiki>
This should fetch any needed dependencies. After that you can compile the project by typing
 <nowiki>sbt compile</nowiki>
and then
 <nowiki>sbt test</nowiki>
to run the tests.
