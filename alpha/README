== Summary ==
We use a simple object model for companies.

== Description ==

These are POJOs plus instance methods for some of the scenarios.
We also enable object de-/serialization for the object model.
To this end, the class implement the empty interface Serializable.

See the tests package for test cases.

Some other projects may leverage this object model.
