== Intent ==

Multithreading implementation in [[Language:Java]].

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]] (Version 5)

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Multithreading]]
* [[101profile:Simple Java|Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]

== Motivation ==

'''This project was created at the PTT-Hackathon 2011'''

== Illustration ==

== Architecture ==

Package ''org.softlang.company'' hosts the object model for [[101feature:Company]].
The methods for [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]] are implemented as classes
named Actions and hosted in ''org.softlang.action''. They implement the basic Action
interface ''org.softlang.action.Action''. These can be used with a descendant of the
interface Context hosted in ''org.softlang.context''. There are two implementations:
ConcurrentContext and SequentialContext.  The methods should be called with
CompanyContextManager, which organizes the call on all direct connected departments.
The class CompanyCreator ensures adequate large companies for testing to (hopefully)
see the boost of multithreading. There is an internal timeout if we have a TotalAction
to ensure all threads are finished before returning the result;

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project. 
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Basics'' with JUnit to exercise basic features and ensure working of CompanyCreator.
** Run class ''Threads'' with JUnit to exercise threading.
