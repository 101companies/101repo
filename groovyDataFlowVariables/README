== Intent ==

A Groovy-based implementation that uses data flow variables

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Groovy]] 

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Eclipse]] IDE (Version 3.7)
* [[Technology:Groovy-Eclipse]]  Eclipse plugin (Version 2.5.1)
* [[Technology:GPars]] Parallel computing framework (Version 0.12)
* [[Technology:JUnit]] Unit testing (Version 4.8.2)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Parallelism]]

== Motivation == 

Groovy is one of the most well-known JVM languages. One of its strength lies 
in the GPars framework, which offers many different approaches to parallel 
programming. A interesting concept is the concurrency based on data flow. 
The overall idea is the creation of a temporal order between processes due to 
the availability of certain values. This project demonstrates the usage of 
this data flow concurrency in Groovy using data flow variables.

== Architecture ==

* ''Company.groovy'' everything related to a company
* ''Department.groovy'' everything related to a department
* ''Employee.groovy'' everything related to an employee
* ''Basic.groovy'' basic functionality tests with a sample company

== Usage ==

You need to install the Eclipse plugin Groovy-Eclipse. 
Update Site: [http://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/e3.7/]

Then open ''Basic.groovy'' and start the JUnit test case you like.
