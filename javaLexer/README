== Intent ==

[[:Category:lexer]]-based text processing in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

A simple custom-made lexer is used to process a text-based representation of companies.
The lexer uses a lookahead of 1 for decision making.
The lexer reports all tokens including whitespace.
[[101feature:Total]] is implemented by means of finding token sequences 
consisting of keyword "salary" followed by a number while ignoring whitespace
in between. [[101feature:Cut]] copies lexemes to an output stream while
modifying salaries. The the lexemes for whitespace token transport layout from 
input to ouput. Because of the combination of lexer and pretty printing, 
it is fair to say that the implementation covers [[101feature:Serialization]].

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project. 
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Operations'' with JUnit to exercise basic operations.
