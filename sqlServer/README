== Intent ==

a relational database model for [[Technology:SQL Server]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:SQL Server]]: SQL Server 2008 used as a data storage. (Free Express edition is enough)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]] 
* [[101feature:Indexing]] 

== Motivation ==

[[Language:SQL]] is used to create relational representation of 101comanies model. Bacis SQL primitives are used: 
*Tables -- to represent an entiry; 
*Primary/Foreing keys -- to represent different types of relationships;
*Triggers -- to represent constrains/cardinality.
This model is used in [[Technology:O/R Mapping]] scenarious for [[Technology:.NET]]-based technologies.

== Architecture ==
The following artifacts are used to create relational model for 101companies:
* Tables (TableName.table.sql)
* Primary keys (Name.pkey.sql)
* Foreign keys (Name.fkey.sql)
* Triggers (Name.trigger.sql)

Scripts/Post-Deployment folder contais script file executed after the database schema was created to fill in the database with actual 101companies data.

== Usage ==
[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file. Deploy option should be used to create the database.
Target connection (in project properties) should be adjusted for your local database server.
