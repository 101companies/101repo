== Intent ==

an implementation in a relational database using [[Technology:SQL Server]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:SQL Server]] (Version 2008)
* [[Technology:Visual Studio]] (Version 2010)

The free Express edition of SQL Server 2008 is sufficient.

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]

== Motivation ==

Please note: ''This implementation is prerequisite for
[[101implementation:ef]].'' A simple relational schema is used to
model the data part of the [[101companies:System]]. In particular,
there are tables for companies, departments, employees (and
persons). Further, there are primary and foreign keys that represent
different types of relationships. For instance, departments associate
themselves with a company by a foreign key. The SQL-based
implementation also includes triggers--to represent
constrains/cardinality. Finally, there are SQL scripts covering the
operations for totaling and cutting salaries.  An implementation of
the query for the depth of departmental nesting is available as well,
but it is strikingly complex because of SQL's known issues with
recursion.

== Architecture ==

The following artifacts are used to create relational model for
101companies:

* Tables (TableName.table.sql)
* Primary keys (Name.pkey.sql)
* Foreign keys (Name.fkey.sql)
* Triggers (Name.trigger.sql)

The scripts/Post-Deployment folder contains script file executed after
the database schema was created to fill in the database with actual
101companies data.

== Usage ==

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project
file. The deploy option should be used to create the database. The
target connection (in project properties) should be adjusted for the
local database server.
