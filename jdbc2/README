This is a sophistication of project "jdbc".
Please make sure you understand "jdbc" first.
Both projects also rely on project "sql"; see README in project "jdbc".

We experiment with a naive O/R mapping for companies.
We exercise some company scenarios with the resulting object model.
In the implementation of the O/R mapping, we use JDBC.

The package org.softlang.company contains the object model.
The ObjectFactory is used to retrieve objects from the database.
The PersistenceTool writes objects back to the database.
Some minimal effort is made to only commit *changes* to the database.

See the tests package for test cases.

Prerequisites (very much like in project "jdbc"):

- A suitable company database.
  Please use project "sql" to set up the company database.
  That is, we assume that you have an initial database image.
  Scenario tests will only succeed for an *initial* database image.
  Corollary: tests will succeed at most once.
  The test class Persistence should succeed for any database image.

- A suitable JDBC Driver for MySQL:
  An appropriate driver is available through the project "library".
  See the corresponding JAR in the build path of the present project.
