== Intent ==

use [[Language:TGraphs]] with [[Technology:JGraLab]] in [[Language:Java]]

== Status ==

[[101status:Featured]]

== Motivation ==

TGraphs are typed, attributed, ordered, and directed graphs.
TGraphs can be maintained in a repository and programmatically processed.
One can clearly use TGraphs to represent companies.
In fact, a TGraphs schema defines the structure of companies.
One can then use supplementary languages and technologies to query and transform such graphs 
so that typical operations on companies are implemented.
In particular, [[Technology:JGraLab]] supports Java-class generation from a TGraphs schema,
and query evaluation with [[Language:GReQL]] on TGraphs.
Transformations can be performed with [[Language:GReTL]]
or ''plain'' Java based on the schema-derived API.

== Languages ==

* [[Language:TGraphs]]
* [[Language:GReQL]]
* [[Language:GReTL]]
* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:JGraLab]]: Java-based support for the TGraph technical space
* [[Technology:GReTL]]: the implementation of [[Language:GReTL]]
* [[Technology:GraphViz]]
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Mentoring]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]
* [[101feature:Visualization]]

== Architecture ==

The file ''101companies-schema.xmi'' is the schema TGraph that represents the data
structure for companies. This file was exported from the
IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA) tool and is based on a simple UML class diagram.
The file ''101companies-schema.pdf'' illustrates the UML class diagram that was
modeled to represent the schema. The file ''101companies-schema.emx'' is the original IBM RSA model file.
Once generated, the file ''101companies-schema.tg''

The jgralab.jar contains the core technology for creating and operating on TGraphs.
It also contains the facilities for using GReQL. The gretl.jar contains GReTL for modifying TGraphs.

Package ''src.de.uni_koblenz.oneoonecompanies'' contains a programmer-defined
class ''CompanyServices'' that provides an API for several operations on TGraphs. 
Packages ''src.de.uni_koblenz.oneoonecompanies.schema'' and ''...schema.impl.std''
contain schema-derived interfaces and classes for companies.
	
== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* Run ''build.xml'' with ant to generate schema-derived classes and interfaces. 
* There are tests in package ''...tests''.
** Run JUnit test ''Serialization'' to exercise the serialization capability.
** Run JUnit test ''Operations'' to exercise the basic operations.
** Run main method of ''Visualization'' to exercise the visualization capability.

Please note: Upon initial checkout and whenever the TGraphs schema ''101companies-schema.xmi''
is changed, then code generation must be re-executed. To this end, run ''ant'' on the included 
''build.xml'' file from the command line or from within Eclipse. This process re-generates 
all types in the packages ''...schema'' and ''...schema.impl.std''.  These packages provide
the API for ''CompanyServices''.
