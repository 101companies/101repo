== Intent ==

advanced modular implementations of some features in [[Language:AspectJ]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:AspectJ]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:AJDT]]: compilation and IDE support for AspectJ
* [[Technology:AspectJ compiler]]: compilation (provided by AJDT)
* [[Technology:JSE]]: execution platform (Version 1.6)
* [[Technology:JUnit]]: automated testing support (Version 4)
* [[Technology:Eclipse]]: optional IDE (Version 3.6)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Logging]]

== Motivation ==

Some concepts of [[aspect-oriented programming]] are put to work. The starting 
point is a simple [[object model]] for companies without any interesting methods,
but only [[getter]]s, [[setter]]s, and [[constructor method]]s. Some computations
on companies are provided by means of [[inter-type declaration]]s. Here it should
be noted that the object model uses an abstract base class of subunits which 
implies that operations on the object model should be implemented in terms of 
[[virtual method]]s. Inter-type declarations allow us here to implement those
virtual methods "after the fact" in an extra module. (If we were not using 
[[subtype polymorphism]], then we can use static methods instead of instance 
methods--in which case computations can be modularized without inter-type 
declarations; see [[101implementation:java2]].) Besides, logging is 
supported by [[around advice]] attached to any call for cutting salaries. 

== Architecture ==

Package ''org.softlang.company'' hosts the object model for [[101feature:Company]].
The Java classes of this object model do not implement any other features.
Package ''org.softlang.aspectj'' hosts aspects for [[101feature:Total]], 
[[101feature:Cut]], [[101feature:Depth]], and [[101feature:Logging]]. There is 
another aspect ''Polymorphism'' which rehashes existing operations (getName,
total, cut) as an interface ''Operations'' on the relevant classes. Finally, 
package ''org.softlang.aspectj.tests'' hosts JUnit tests; see below.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project.
* AJDT must be installed in Eclipse if Eclipse is to be used.
* Open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available as the package ''org.softlang.java.tests''.
** Run class Tests with JUnit to exercise all features.
