== Usage ==

You need a web- and sql-server to use this application. In this tutorial both will take by XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

This tutorial adopts some parts of [[101implementation:mySql]]. We will use the company.sql and sampleCompany.sql from this project below:

* Download and install XAMPP
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Create a new User "101companies" with Password "101companies" and a new Database "101companies" (use the XAMPP-Tutorial)
* Create Tables for the 101companies-application (company.sql)
* Populate Tables (sampleCompany.sql)

After the database is running, follow the next steps:

* To start the application, you need to download all files except the README
* Put the files into the htdocs-directory of your XAMPP (a new sub-directory in "htdocs" is recommended)
* Run index.html
