== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:HTML5]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:HTML5]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]
* [[Language:php]]
* [[Language:SQL]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:MySQL]]
* [[Technology:XAMPP]]
* [[Technology:Apache_HTTP_Server|Apache HTTP Server]]
* [[Technology:XMLHttpRequest]]
* [[Technology:Webbrowser]] (HTML5 compliant)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]

== Motivation ==

This [[Language:HTML5|HTML5]]-project provides an optimized [[server-side]] data storage. While other projects like [[101implementation:XMLHttpRequest]] transmit the whole company-data from the [[server]] to the [[client]], this application only transmit the necessary data for the current page. This is realized with [[Technology:XMLHttpRequest]] and a [[server-side]] [[Language:php]]-script. The client sends a request to the [[server]] and the [[Language:php]]-script decides, which data should be transmit. The transmitting-data are wrapped in a stringified [[Technology:JSON]]-Object. It is evident to use [[Language:SQL]] for data storage in combination with the [[server-side]] [[Language:php]]-script.

== Usage ==

You need a web- and sql-server to use this application. In this tutorial both will take by XAMPP: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

This tutorial adopts some parts of [[101implementation:mySql]]. We will use the company.sql and sampleCompany.sql from this project below:

* Download and install XAMPP
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Create a new User "101companies" with Password "101companies" and a new Database "101companies" (use the tutorial: http://www.php-einfach.de/einf_mysql.php)
* Create Tables for the 101companies-application (company.sql)
* Populate Tables (sampleCompany.sql)

After the database is running, follow the next steps:

* To start the application, you need to download all project-files except the README
* Put the files into the htdocs-directory of your XAMPP (a new sub-directory in "htdocs" is recommended)
* Run index.html
