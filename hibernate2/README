This is a variation on project "hibernate". 
See "hibernate"'s README for steps of a typical demo.
The variation is concerned with object model and relational schema details.
That is, "hibernate2"'s object model is mapped to a relational schema, 
which represents the company structure in a compositional way, while "hibernate"'s
relational schema uses backward references.
