== Intent ==

a basic implementation of the spec in Python 3

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Python 3.2]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Py3k]]: The Python 3000 reference implementation aka "CPython" (Version 3.2)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Serialization]]

== Motivation ==

Python is a dynamically typed scripting language, mainly focussed on OO-programming but nonetheless offering some tools to also provide basic functional programming capabilities. Python also prides itself on it's "Batteries included" philosophy which means that the language's standard library shouldcover all possible basic use cases of the language. This implementation takes the basic OO approach, implementing Company, Dept and Employee as classes, though due to python's dynamic approach, no inheritance hierarchy is needed (we could do this using dictionaries and classes in fact aren't that much more).
Using Python's Pickle serialization module, the whole model can be serialized without further adaptation.
The model implements structural equality, but only for the purpose of unit testing serialization.

== Architecture ==

All classes and methods are contained in ''Company.py''. Tests are in ''CompanyTest.py''.
The [[101feature:Serialization]] is achieved using the pickle module.

== Usage ==

Make sure to grab Python 3 from python.org, then from the project directory execute

 <nowiki>python3 CompanyTest.py -v</nowiki>

to run the test cases
