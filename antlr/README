We define a concrete syntax for companies.
We use ANTLR to execute that syntax in an acceptor-like manner.

See the Tests class for test cases.

An appropriate ANTLR runtime etc. is imported from project "library".
There are Makefiles at the top of the project and within the org.softlang.antlr package.
Run "make" at either of these locations to re-generate the parser.
Refresh the project in Eclipse if you re-generated outside Eclipse.
In this manner, the parser is compiled.

You may also use an ANTLR IDE.
http://antlrv3ide.sourceforge.net/

Just for fun, here is the signature corresponding to the grammar.

Introduced sorts
 Company,
 Dept,
 Employee
 
Assumed sorts
 Float,
 String,
 List(_)
 
Function symbols:
 company  : List(Dept) -> Company
 dept     : String x Employee x List(Employee) x List(Dept) -> Dept
 employee : String x String x Float -> Employee
 
 Notes:
 - We allow ourselves lists.
 
== Issues ==
Parsing error does not make JUnit test case fail.
