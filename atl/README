We address the company scenarios with ATL (model-to-model transformations).
To this end, an Eclipse with sufficient M2M support is needed.
Update-Site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/m2m/updates/site.xml

The Company.ecore metamodel models companies. 
The Total.ecore metamodel is basically a wrapper for a double value. (both metamodels in "org/softlang/ecore")

The ATL transformation Cut.atl implements the scenario "cut".
It uses the metamodel Company.ecore for input and output.

The ATL transformation Total.atl implements the scenario "total".
It uses the metamodel Company.ecore for the input.
It uses the trivial metamodel Total.ecore for the output.

Running the transformations

Steps:
- Select the ATL file in the package explorer.
- Right click 
- Select "Run As" -> "ATL Transformation"
- Fill in the values to point to input and output models.

Comments:
- The locations for the metamodels are taken from the .atl files.
- You can also specific a "run configuration" as usual.
