== Architecture ==

''company.*'' contains the generated model code for companies. In ''org.softlang.util'' we define functionality to 
[[101feature:Total|total]] and [[101feature:Cut|cut]] salaries. This package also hosts ''Tests.java'' for testing purposes.
The ''model'' folder contains the actual ecore model for companies.
With the ''ecore-xmi-2.2.3'' jar we get an XMLResourceFactory serilize companies to xml.

== Usage ==

We make use of the EMF Plugin.
