@Thomas, split up "usage" below to move relevant stuff here.

@Thomas, please modernize "usage" also.

== Usage ==

We make use of the EMF Plugin.
Update-Site: http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/updates/releases/

Requirements
- With the "ecore-xmi-2.2.3.jar" we get XMIResourceFactory and XMLResourceFactory implementations.(see library Project @ Sourceforge: 
  http://developers.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/developers/repository/101companies/code/library/emf) 

The scenarios are concerned with the "company" data structure.
That is, there are hierarchically organized departments.
There are managers and other employees.
Those have names and they receive a salary.

In a new "Empty EMF Project" we model the company's structure with EMF's Ecore.
We can now ask Eclipse to derive the EMF Generator File (Right-click on the Ecore file in the Package Explorer ->  Eugenia -> Generate EMF GenModel),
with which we are able to generate the company's object model (Right-click on top tree-node in the EMF Generator -> Generate Model Code).

In the cutAndTotal package we implement functionality to cut and total salaries in a given company.
We test these classes in Tests. 
By making use of EMF's Resource and ResourceSet classes and implementations of XMIResourceFactory and XMLResourceFactory we are able to:
  - deserialize XMI data to company objects
  - total and cut salaries on those objects
  - serialize the manipulated objects to XML data.
  
An XML Schema can be generated by:
  - right-click on the Company.genmodel file in the package-explorer
  - choose "Export model..."
  - click "XML Schema" 
  - specify the destination folder
  - choose the Ecore package "company" and click "Finish"
